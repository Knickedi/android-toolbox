/**
 * Swipeable list item view.<br>
 * <br>
 * A view which want to use the technique described by {@link SwipeableListView} should implement
 * this interface and follow the rules descried here.<br>
 * <br>
 * The whole process of swipe is controlled by {@link #onViewSwipe(ListView, SwipeEvent, int, int)}
 * and the given {@link SwipeEvent}. {@link #swipeOnClick()}, {@link #swipeOnLongClick()} and
 * {@link #swipeDoesntHideListSelector()} return some extra settings.<br>
 * {@link #swipeStateReset()} is there for a clean handling.<br>
 * <br>
 * See {@link SwipeEvent} for a description of events and how to handle them.<br>
 * <br>
 * Further there is {@link SwipeableSetup} as helper for developing swipeable views.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Note</b>: This view itself can only listen for touch events in range of
 * {@link android.view.ViewConfiguration#getTouchSlop()}. Vertical move will be intercepted for list
 * scroll and horizontal move will be intercepted for swipe. So in the end you can listen for clicks
 * only since move action will e canceled after a certain offset.

	/**
	 * Base class for swipeable view configuration (as helper for an own swipeable view
	 * implementation).<br>
	 * <br>
	 * It's your decision whether you use it for your own implementation of a swipeable or not. It
	 * just simplifies the configuration of the common values for a swipeable view.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * You could create an own swipeable view and pass an object of a class which extends this one
	 * to it. So you have full control over the settings in an central object and don't need to set
	 * it on each view. Besides that you can share central objects between different swipeable views
	 * (layouts, images, etc).<br>
	 * <br>
	 * <b>Example</b>: (You don't have to lock your setup or make the setup single, it's just an
	 * example. If your swipeable view gets along with changes its fine. You could also lock setup
	 * on a certain swipeable view state. <i>Note</i>: Only some configurations are locked in this
	 * base class, see it's documentation.)<br>
